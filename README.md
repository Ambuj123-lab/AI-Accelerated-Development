AI-Accelerated Development
This portfolio showcases my journey into the new era of software engineering, where we leverage the power of intelligence to build tomorrow's solutions. As an AI Solutions Engineer, this project demonstrates my ability to use AI as a creative partner, not just a tool, to accelerate the development process and deliver high-quality results.

"The power of what you're going to be able to create on the web, we haven't given that power to developers in 25 years."
Key Features
Dynamic UI: An immersive, color-changing background that reacts to mouse movement.

AI Impact Dashboard: A simulated real-time dashboard that visually compares the time spent and efficiency between AI-assisted and manual development.

Professional Overview: A concise showcase of my core skills and key projects.

Theme & Concept
The central theme of this portfolio is the "Trust But Verify" approach to AI-assisted coding. It highlights my philosophy that AI is not just a tool, but a collaborative partner that empowers us to work faster and more efficiently.

This project serves as a bridge between my skills in AI for business applications and hands-on technical execution.
